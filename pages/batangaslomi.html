            Batangas lomi, The first time I had this(well not really but it's the most memorable experience i've had eating a batangas lomi), was when my college friends were craving to eat some batangas lomi, and sure enough we found one near their hometown, <em>again</em>. so once we finished our class on that day we all head on to the Batangas lomi <em>Karinderya</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When we all finally got together on the <em>Karinderya</em>(Some of us have motorcycles, and some had to commute), We all sat down and looked at the menu. The servings they offer for the Batangas lomi ranges from good for 1 person up to 5-6 person per bowl, and sure enough we  ordered the one good for 5-6 persons, <em>each</em>, well except one of our friend, who ordered the one good for 2-3 persons. I also wanted a smaller serving as well for my first time, but I succumbed to the peer pressure so I also ordered the <strong>MEGA</strong> size. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the waitress brought our orders, I was <strong>very</strong> surprised by size of that thing! even the waitress was shocked, she said she expected alot of people were there to eat since let me remind you that the serving that we ordered they said were for <em>5-6 persons</em> and her seeing this 7 starved broke college students each order a plate of such quantity, she just laughed and told us if we are serious about this and we can always request for a takeout if we didn't finish it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It was a very pleasant memory and yes, we all did finish our bowls.
