            Welcome to my <strong>Shawarma Rice</strong> Recipe!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Fun fact during my college days, me and my friends would sometimes go visit one of our friends' hometown whenever we want to celebrate or just plain old eat a tasty Shawarma Rice filled with extra sauces and <strong>meat</strong>! and sometimes we would go to his house to eat Shawarma rice and hangout.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I would never admit this to them that the Shawarma rice from their hometown, is <em>top notch</em>. I ate alot of Shawarma Rice,in comparison from the ones sold at my town to the Shawarma rice sold from the old workplace I did my internship in, and I could assure you <em>nothing</em> comes close. Their Shawarma rice is just so much better, a league of its own, plus you can't beat the memories made from each bite from it.

        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, <em>grated</em></li>

        <li>1 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>

        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp kasubha <em>(safflower)</em></li>
        <li>2 cups long-grain rice, like <em>jasmin</em> or <em>basmati</em>, <em>rinsed</em> and <em>drained</em></li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>

        <li>3 native tomatoes, <em>seeded</em> and <em>sliced thinly</em></li>
        <li>2 large Japanese cucumbers, <em>seeded</em> and <em>sliced thinly</em></li>
        <li>2 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>

        <li>1 cup plain yoghurt, preferably <em>Greek</em></li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, <em>grated</em></li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Marinate Beef:</h4>
            In a large bowl, combine the beef with the soy sauce, garlic, brown sugar, rice vinegar, and cumin. Set aside and let marinate for 20 minutes to 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Make yellow rice:</h4>
            Melt butter in a pot over medium heat. Once foaming, add turmeric and kasubha to the butter and cook, 3 minutes. Add long-grain rice and stir until grains are toasty and evenly coated with butter, about 5 minutes. Add water and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to maintain a simmer. Cover pot and cook rice as usual.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Make side salad:</h4>
            Add tomatoes, cucumbers, rice vinegar, and olive oil to a mixing bowl. Toss until vegetables are well coated. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside in the refrigerator until ready to use.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Make garlic yogurt sauce:</h4>
            Combine yogurt, garlic, and garlic powder in a small mixing bowl (or in the plastic cup the yogurt came in). Season with salt and pepper. Taste to adjust seasoning, then transfer sauce to a squeeze bottle.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Cook beef:</h4>
            Heat pan over high heat. Add beef and sear until a crust forms, 2 minutes. Flip to sear the second side, another 2 minutes. Remove beef from pan and let rest on a chopping board for 5â€“7 minutes. Using a sharp knife, slice the beef into small bite-sized pieces (about 1cm squares).
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Assemble and serve:</h4>
            Divide turmeric rice between bowls. Top rice with chopped beef, then add a spoonful of salad on the side. Drizzle garlic yogurt sauce over everything; the iconic zigzag motion is required. Serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>

        And that's it! enjoy your Shawarma rice!
