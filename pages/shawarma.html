        Shawarma Rice Recipe
    </h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to my <strong>Shawarma Rice</strong> Recipe!
    </p>
    <p>
        Fun fact during my college days, me and my friends would sometimes go visit one of our friends' hometown whenever we want to celebrate or just plain old eat a tasty Shawarma Rice filled with extra sauces! and sometimes we go would to his house to eat kebab and hangout.

        I would never admit it to them but the Shawarma rice from their hometown, is <em>top notch</em>. I ate alot of kebab, from the ones sold at my town to the kebab sold from the old workplace I did my internship in, and nothing comes close. Their Shawarma rice is just so much better, a league of its own, plus you can't beat the memories made from each bite from it.
