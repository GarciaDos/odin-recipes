# odin-recipes
A simple HTML project from The Odin Project, where I create a simple recipe website

#Self reflection:
Creating the basic structures of my website was way more fun than I have expected, although it may not look good without the proper design with a css, I like to think that it has a charm of it's own.

This has been a good exercise to brush up  my HTML skills again, and hopefully I can continue this productivity in the future.

Also the topic about the links security with the help of target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer", is actually good! I'll try my best to use this everytime as needed when I create a link on my webpage.
